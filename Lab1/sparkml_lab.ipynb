    "2. `latitude`: a measure of how far north a house is (a higher value is farther north)\n",
    "3. `housing_,median_age`: median age of a house within a block (a lower number is a newer building)\n",

    "One way to get all attributes to have the same scale is to use standardization. In standardization, for each value, first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. To do this, we can use the `StandardScaler` Estimator. To use `StandardScaler`, again we need to convert all the numerical attributes into a big vectore of features using `VectorAssembler`, and then call `StandardScaler` on that vactor."

    "# 6. Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "An important task in Machie Learning is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for a given task. This is also called tuning. Tuning may be done for individual Estimators such as LinearRegression, or for entire Pipelines which include multiple algorithms, featurization, and other steps. Users can tune an entire Pipeline at once, rather than tuning each element in the Pipeline separately. MLlib supports model selection tools, such as `CrossValidator`. These tools require the following items:\n",
    "* Estimator: algorithm or Pipeline to tune (`setEstimator`)\n",
    "* Set of ParamMaps: parameters to choose from, sometimes called a \"parameter grid\" to search over (`setEstimatorParamMaps`)\n",
    "* Evaluator: metric to measure how well a fitted Model does on held-out test data (`setEvaluator`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`CrossValidator` begins by splitting the dataset into a set of folds, which are used as separate training and test datasets. For example with `k=3` folds, `CrossValidator` will generate 3 (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing. To evaluate a particular `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` computes the average evaluation metric for the 3 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 3 different (training, test) dataset pairs. After identifying the best `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` finally re-fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, use the `CrossValidator` to select the best Random Forest model. To do so, you need to define a grid of parameters. Let's say we want to do the search among the different number of trees (1, 5, and 10), and different tree depth (5, 10, and 15)."

    "This research aimed at the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel \"Sorting Smoothing Method\" to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.\n",

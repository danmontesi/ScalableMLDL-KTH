## Description
Repository of all the deliverables developed for the course in KTH: ID2223 course, part of the Double Degree Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science & Distibuted Systems track @EIT Digital.

**Course Website**(https://id2223kth.github.io)

**Review Questions**
Contains the Answers to the 6 Review Questions files during the course
* `RQ1`: Basics of Machine Learning and Linear Regression
* `RQ2`: Linear Regression and Linear Classification
* `RQ3`: Decision Trees, Ensembles, NN Basics
* `RQ4`: Deep Learning: RNN, CNN, RBM
* `RQ5`: GANs and Reinforcement Learning basics
* `RQ6`: Distributed ML Principles

**Labs**
* `lab1`: Boston housing dataset and Default Payments analysis developed with SparkML in Scala
* `lab2`: Re-Implementation of Inveption v3 CNN and Neuro-Image Caption creator reimplementation based on [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308303415_Image_Caption_Generation_using_Recurrent_Neural_Network)**

**Project: Spotify Sequenatial Skip Prediction Challenge**
With this project we would like to use Deep Learning to model a solution to the challenge ” Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge - Predict if users will skip or listen to the music they’re streamed” published by Spotify in collaboration with WSDM and CrowdAI.
[Challenge Website and Dataset](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge)

To this extent, we developed 4 Notebooks:
* `1. Data Exploration.ipynb`
* `2. Dataset Creation.ipynb`
* `3. Model Creation & Prediction.ipynb`
* `4. Feature Engineering.ipynb`
We trained the model using GPU offered by Google Colab.
